# Codebasics_RPC_1-Hospitality-Booking-Revenue-Analysis
This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 1, where I analyzed booking and revenue data for AtliQ Hotels, a hospitality chain with both Luxury and Business class properties.
📌 Project Overview
The objective was to build a Power BI dashboard that helps stakeholders track key hotel performance metrics and make better revenue management decisions.

🎯 Business Problem

AtliQ Hotels faced challenges in understanding:

Which hotel segments (Luxury vs Business) generate more revenue.

How occupancy and cancellations affect profitability.

Seasonal booking patterns and demand fluctuations.

Which pricing strategies can boost revenue and occupancy.

📊 Key Hospitality Metrics (KPIs)

The dashboard includes the following industry-standard KPIs:

RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Revenue generated per available room.

ADR (Average Daily Rate): Average revenue per occupied room per day.

DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Average number of rooms booked per day.

DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Average number of rooms actually used per day.

Occupancy %: Share of rooms sold compared to total available rooms.

Realization %: Ratio of actual stays to total bookings (impacted by cancellations and no-shows).

💡 Insights from the Dashboard

Luxury Hotels: High ADR & RevPAR but lower occupancy rates.

Business Hotels: Consistent occupancy and realization, but lower ADR.

Seasonal Demand Patterns: Peaks on weekends/festivals and dips during off-peak periods.

📈 Recommendations

Dynamic Pricing Strategy

Increase prices during high demand periods (weekends, holidays, events).

Offer discounts during low demand periods to boost occupancy.

Improve Realization % by reducing cancellations & no-shows.

Balance between premium pricing (ADR) and occupancy stability to maximize revenue.
